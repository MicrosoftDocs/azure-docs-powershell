> In December 2018, the Az PowerShell module became generally available and is now the recommended
> PowerShell module for interacting with Azure. Az offers shorter commands, improved stability, and
> cross-platform support. Az also has feature parity with AzureRM, giving you an easy migration
> path. To learn how to migrate your existing scripts, see
> [Migrate Azure PowerShell from AzureRM to Az](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/migrate-from-azurerm-to-az).
> The AzureRM module will continue to receive bug fixes until at least December of 2020. To learn
> more about the new Az module and AzureRM compatibility, see
> [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).
