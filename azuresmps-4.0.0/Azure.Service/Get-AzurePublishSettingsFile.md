# Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile

## SYNOPSIS
Downloads the publish settings file for an Azure subscription.

## SYNTAX

```
Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile [-Environment <String>] [-Realm <String>] [-PassThru] [-Profile <AzureSMProfile>]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile** cmdlet downloads a publish settings file for a subscription in your account.
When the command completes, you can use the **Import-PublishSettingsFile** cmdlet to make the settings in the file available to Windows PowerShell.

To make your Azure account available to Windows PowerShell, you can use a publish settings file or the **Add-AzureAccount** cmdlet.
Publish settings files let you prepare the session in advance so you can run scripts and background jobs unattended.
However, not all services support publish settings files.
For example, the **AzureResourceManager** module does not support publish settings files.

When you run **Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile**, it opens your default browser and prompts you to sign into your Azure account, select a subscription, and select a file system location for the publish settings file.
Then, it downloads the publish settings file for your subscription into the file that you selected.

A "publish settings file" is an XML file with a .publishsettings file name extension.
The file contains an encoded certificate that provides management credentials for your Azure subscriptions.

**Security Note:** Publish settings files contains credentials that are used to administer your Azure subscriptions and services.
If  malicious users access your publish settings file,  they can edit, create, and delete your Azure services.
As a security best practice, save the file to a location in your Downloads or Documents folder and then delete it after using **Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile** cmdlet to import the settings.

This topic describes the cmdlet in the 0.8.10 version of the Microsoft Azure PowerShell module.
To get the version of the module you're using, in the Azure PowerShell console, type `(Get-Module -Name Azure).Version`.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Download a publish settings file
```
PS C:\> Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile
```

This command opens your default browser, connects to your Windows Azure account, and then downloads the .publishsettings file for your account.

### Example 2: Specify a realm
```
PS C:\> Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile -Realm contoso.com -Passthru
```

This command downloads the publish settings file for an account in the contoso.com domain.
Use a command with the **Realm** parameter when you sign into Azure with an organizational account, instead of a Microsoft account.
