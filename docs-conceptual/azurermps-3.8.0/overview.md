# Overview of Azure PowerShell

Azure PowerShell provides a set of cmdlets that use the [Azure Resource
Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) model for managing your Azure
resources. You can use it in your browser with [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview), or
you can install it on your local machine and use it in any PowerShell session.

Use the [Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview) to run the Azure PowerShell in your browser, or
[install](install-azurerm-ps.md) it on own computer. Then read the [Get Started](get-started-azureps.md)
article to begin using it. For information about the latest release, see the
[release notes](release-notes-azureps.md).

The following samples can help you learn how to perform common scenarios with Azure PowerShell:

* [Linux Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-powershell-samples?toc=/powershell/azure/toc.json)
* [Windows Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-samples?toc=/powershell/azure/toc.json)
* [Web Apps](/azure/app-service-web/app-service-powershell-samples?toc=/powershell/azure/toc.json)
* [SQL Databases](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-powershell-samples?toc=/powershell/azure/toc.json)

> [!NOTE]
> If you have deployments that use the classic deployment model that cannot be converted,
> you can install the Service Management version of Azure PowerShell. For more information, see
> [Install the Azure PowerShell Service Management module](/powershell/azure/servicemanagement/install-azure-ps).
