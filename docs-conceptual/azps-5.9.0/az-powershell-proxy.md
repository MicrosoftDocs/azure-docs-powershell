# Use the Az PowerShell module behind a proxy

If a proxy is necessary for HTTP request, the Azure PowerShell team recommends the following proxy
configuration for different platforms:

|      **Platform**       |                          **Recommended Proxy Settings**                           |                                               **Comment**                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows PowerShell 5.1  | System proxy settings                                                             | Do not suggest setting HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.                                     |
| PowerShell 7 on Windows | System proxy settings                                                             | Proxy could be configured by setting both HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.              |
| PowerShell 7 on macOS   | System proxy settings                                                             | Proxy could be configured by setting both HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.              |
| PowerShell 7 on Linux   | Set both HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables, plus optional NO_PROXY | The environment variables should be set before starting PowerShell, otherwise they may not be respected. |

The environment variables used are:

- HTTP_PROXY: the proxy server used on HTTP requests.
- HTTPS_PROXY: the proxy server used on HTTPS requests.
- NO_PROXY: a comma-separated list of hostnames that should be excluded from proxying.

On systems where environment variables are case-sensitive, the variable names may be all lowercase
or all uppercase. The lowercase names are checked first.
