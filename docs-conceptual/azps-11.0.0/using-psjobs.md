# Run Azure PowerShell cmdlets in PowerShell Jobs

Azure PowerShell depends on connecting to an Azure cloud and waiting for responses, so most of these
cmdlets block your PowerShell session until they get a response from the cloud. PowerShell Jobs let
you run cmdlets in the background or do multiple tasks on Azure at once, from inside a single
PowerShell session.

This article is a brief overview of how to run Azure PowerShell cmdlets as PowerShell Jobs and check
for completion. Running commands in Azure PowerShell requires the use of Azure PowerShell contexts,
which are covered in detail in [Azure contexts and sign-in credentials](context-persistence.md). To
learn more about PowerShell Jobs, see
[About PowerShell Jobs](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_jobs).

## Azure contexts with PowerShell jobs

PowerShell Jobs are run as separate processes without an attached PowerShell session, so your Azure
credentials must be shared with them. Credentials are passed as Azure context objects, using one of
these methods:

- Automatic context persistence. Context persistence is enabled by default and preserves your
  sign-in information across multiple sessions. With context persistence enabled, the current Azure
  context is passed to the new process:

  ```azurepowershell-interactive
  Enable-AzContextAutosave # Enables context autosave if not already on
  $vmadmin = Get-Credential

  Start-Job {
    New-AzVM -Name MyVm -Credential $Using:vmadmin
  }
  ```

- Provide an Azure context object with any Azure PowerShell cmdlet that has an **AzContext**
  parameter:

  ```azurepowershell-interactive
  $context = Get-AzContext -Name 'mycontext' # Get an Azure context object
  $vmadmin = Get-Credential

  $job = Start-Job {
    New-AzVM -Name MyVm -AzContext $Using:context -Credential $Using:vmadmin
  }
  ```

  If context persistence is disabled, the **AzContext** parameter is required.

- Use the **AsJob** parameter provided by some Azure PowerShell cmdlets. This switch automatically
  starts the cmdlet as a PowerShell Job, using the active Azure context:

  ```azurepowershell-interactive
  $vmadmin = Get-Credential
  $job = New-AzVM -Name MyVm -Credential $vmadmin -AsJob
  ```

  To see if a cmdlet supports **AsJob**, check its reference documentation. The **AsJob** parameter
  doesn't require context autosave to be enabled.

You can check the status of a running job with the
[Get-Job](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/get-job) cmdlet. To get the output from a job
so far, use the [Receive-Job](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/receive-job) cmdlet.

To check an operation's progress remotely on Azure, use the `Get` cmdlets associated with the type
of resource being modified by the job:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$vmadmin = Get-Credential
$context = Get-AzContext -Name 'mycontext'
$vmName = 'MyVm'

$job = Start-Job {
  New-AzVM -Name $Using:vmName -AzContext $Using:context -Credential $Using:vmadmin
}

Get-Job -Id $job.Id
Get-AzVM -Name $vmName
```
