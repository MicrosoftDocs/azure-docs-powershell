# Using Azure PowerShell in Docker

We are publishing Docker images with Azure PowerShell preinstalled. This article shows you how to
get started using Azure PowerShell in the Docker container.

## Finding available images

The released images require Docker 17.05 or newer. It is also expected that you are able to run
Docker without `sudo` or local administrative rights. Please follow Docker's official
[instructions][install] to install `docker` correctly.

The latest container image contains the latest version of PowerShell and the latest Azure PowerShell
modules supported with the Az module.

For each new release of the Az module we are releasing an image for the following operating systems:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (default)
- Debian 9
- CentOs 7

A full list of available images can be found on our [Docker image][az image] page.

## Using Azure PowerShell in a container

The following steps show the Docker commands required to download the image and start an interactive
PowerShell session.

1. Download the latest azure-powershell image.

   ```console
   docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-powershell
   ```

1. Run the azure-powershell container in interactive mode:

   ```console
   docker run -it mcr.microsoft.com/azure-powershell pwsh
   ```

For Windows Docker hosts, you must enable Docker File Sharing to allow local drives on Windows to be shared with Linux containers. For more information see [Get started with Docker for Windows][file-sharing].

### Run the azure-powershell container interactively using host authentication

If you have Azure PowerShell already installed on the system hosting Docker, you may have cached
Azure credentials. These credentials can be used in the PowerShell session running in the Docker
container.

By default, the cached credentials are in `$HOME/.Azure` directory on your host. The Docker service
must have access to this location to access the credentials. The following command starts the
container with the credential cache mounted and starts an interactive PowerShell session.

```console
docker run -it -v ~/.Azure/AzureRmContext.json:/root/.Azure/AzureRmContext.json -v ~/.Azure/TokenCache.dat:/root/.Azure/TokenCache.dat mcr.microsoft.com/azure-powershell pwsh
```

### Remove the image when no longer needed

The following command is used to delete the Docker container when you no longer need it.

```console
docker rmi mcr.microsoft.com/azure-powershell
```
