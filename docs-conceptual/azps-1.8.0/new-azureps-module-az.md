# Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module

Starting in December 2018, the Azure PowerShell Az module is in general release and now the intended
PowerShell module for interacting with Azure. Az offers shorter commands, improved stability, and
cross-platform support. Az also has feature parity with AzureRM, giving you an easy migration
path.

With the Az module, Azure PowerShell is now compatible with PowerShell 5.1 on Windows and PowerShell Core 6.x
and later on all supported platforms - including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Az is a new module, so the version has been reset to 1.0.0.

## Why a new module?

Major updates can be inconvenient, so it's important that we let you know why the decision was made to
introduce a new set of modules, with new cmdlets, for interacting with Azure from PowerShell.

The biggest and most important change is that PowerShell has been a cross-platform product since the
introduction of [PowerShell Core 6.x](/powershell/scripting/overview), based on the .NET Standard library.
We're committed to bringing Azure support to all platforms, which means that the Azure PowerShell modules
needed to be updated to use .NET Standard and be compatible with PowerShell Core. Rather than taking the
existing AzureRM module and introduce complex changes to add this support, the Az module was created.

Creating a new module also gave our engineers the opportunity to make the design and naming of cmdlets
and modules consistent. All modules now start with the `Az.` prefix and cmdlets all use the
_Verb_-`Az`_Noun_ form. Previously, cmdlet names were not only longer, there were inconsistencies
in cmdlet names.

The number of modules was also reduced: Some modules which worked with the same services have been rolled
together, and management plane and data plane cmdlets are now contained all within single modules for their
services. For those of you who manually manage dependencies and imports, this makes things much simpler.

By making these important changes that required building a new Azure PowerShell module, the team has
committed to making it easier than ever, and on more platforms than previously possible, to use
Azure with PowerShell cmdlets.

## Upgrade to Az

To keep up with the latest Azure features in PowerShell, you should migrate to the Az module as soon as
possible. If you're not ready to install the Az module as a replacement for AzureRM, you have a couple of
options available to experiment with Az:

* Use a `PowerShell` environment with [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).
  Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based shell environment which comes with the Az module installed and `Enable-AzureRM`
  compatibility aliases enabled.
* Keep the AzureRM module installed with PowerShell 5.1 for Windows, but install the Az module for PowerShell Core 6.x
  or later. PowerShell 5.1 for Windows and PowerShell Core use separate collections of modules. Follow the instructions
  to [install PowerShell Core](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows) and then
  [install the Az module](install-az-ps.md) from a PowerShell Core terminal.

To upgrade from an existing AzureRM install:

1. [Uninstall the Azure PowerShell AzureRM module](/powershell/azure/uninstall-az-ps#uninstall-the-azurerm-module)
2. [Install the Azure PowerShell Az module](install-az-ps.md)
3. __OPTIONAL__: Enable compatibility mode to add aliases for AzureRM cmdlets with
  [Enable-AzureRMAlias](/powershell/module/az.accounts/enable-azurermalias) while you become familiar with
  the new command set. See the next section or [Start migration from AzureRM to Az](migrate-from-azurerm-to-az.md)
  for more details.

## Migrate existing scripts to Az

The new cmdlet names have been designed to be easy to learn. Instead of using `AzureRm` or `Azure`
in cmdlet names, use `Az`. For example, the old command `New-AzureRMVm` has become `New-AzVm`.
Migration is more than just becoming familiar with the new cmdlet names, though: There are renamed
modules, parameters, and other important changes.

To help you with the process of migration from AzureRM to Az, we've got a number of resources:

* [Get started with migration from AzureRM to Az](migrate-from-azurerm-to-az.md)
* [Full list of breaking changes from AzureRM to Az 1.0.0](migrate-az-1.0.0.md)
* The [Enable-AzureRmAlias](/powershell/module/az.accounts/enable-azurermalias) cmdlet

The Az module has a compatibility mode to help you use existing scripts while you 
update to the new syntax. The [Enable-AzureRmAlias](/powershell/module/az.accounts/enable-azurermalias)
cmdlet enables a compatibility mode through aliases, to allow you to use existing scripts with minimal
modification while working towards a full migration to Az.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Even though the cmdlet names are aliased, there may still be new (or renamed) parameters or changed
> return values for the Az cmdlets. Don't expect enabling aliases to take care of the migration
> for you! See the [full breaking changes list](migrate-az-1.0.0.md) to find where your scripts may
> require updates.

## Continued support for AzureRM

AzureRM will no longer receive new cmdlets or features. However, the AzureRM module is still officially maintained
and will get bug fixes through December 2020.
