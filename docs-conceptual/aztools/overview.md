# Az Tools PowerShell modules overview

The Azure PowerShell team has created a set of tool modules that extend the capabilities of Azure
PowerShell. These modules can be installed from the PowerShell Gallery and loaded on demand. The
modules aren't officially part of Azure PowerShell, but the Azure PowerShell product team maintains
them. The level of support for each module varies. For more details, see the overview page for each
module.

This documentation set contains cmdlet references for the following modules.

- [Az.Tools.Installer][az-tools-installer]
- [Az.Tools.Predictor][az-tools-predictor]
- [Az.Tools.Migration][az-tools-migration]
