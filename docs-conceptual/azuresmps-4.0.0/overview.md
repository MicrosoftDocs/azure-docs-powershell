# Overview of the Azure PowerShell Service Management module

Azure Service Management is the classic deployment model. This module allows you to work with you
classic Azure deployments that have not been converted to Azure Resource Manager. Any new
deployments should use the Azure Resource Manager methods. To use the cmdlets, you need to install
and configure Azure PowerShell to connect it to your account. For more information, see
[Install and configure Azure PowerShell](install-azure-ps.md).
