# Uninstall the Azure PowerShell module

[!INCLUDE [migrate-to-az](../includes/migrate-to-az.md)]

This article tells you how to uninstall an older version of Azure PowerShell, or completely remove it from
your system. If you've decided to completely uninstall the Azure PowerShell, please give us some feedback
through the [Send-Feedback](/powershell/module/azurerm.profile/send-feedback) cmdlet.
If you encountered a bug, we'd appreciate it if you [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/azure/azure-powershell/issues).

## Uninstall MSI or Web Platform Installer

If you installed Azure PowerShell using the MSI package or the Web Platform Installer, you must uninstall through the Windows
system rather than PowerShell.

| Platform | Instructions |
|----------|--------------|
| Windows 10 | Start > Settings > Apps |
| Windows 7 </br>Windows 8 | Start > Control Panel > Programs > Uninstall a program |

Once on this screen you should see "Azure PowerShell" in the program listing, and can uninstall from there.

## Uninstall from PowerShell

If you installed Azure PowerShell using PowerShellGet, you can use the
[Uninstall-Module](/powershell/module/powershellget/uninstall-module) cmdlet. However,
`Uninstall-Module` only uninstalls one module. To remove Azure PowerShell completely, you must
uninstall each module individually. Uninstallation can be complicated if you have multiple versions of Azure
PowerShell installed.

You use the following script can be used to completely remove a single version of Azure PowerShell. The
script queries the PowerShell Gallery to get a list of dependent submodules. Then, the script
uninstalls the correct version of each submodule.

```powershell-interactive
function Uninstall-AllModules {
  param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$TargetModule,

    [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
    [string]$Version,

    [switch]$Force,

    [switch]$WhatIf
  )
  
  $AllModules = @()
  
  'Creating list of dependencies...'
  $target = Find-Module $TargetModule -RequiredVersion $version
  $target.Dependencies | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_.PSObject.Properties.Name -contains 'requiredVersion') {
      $AllModules += New-Object -TypeName psobject -Property @{name=$_.name; version=$_.requiredVersion}
    }
    else { # Assume minimum version
      # Minimum version actually reports the installed dependency
      # which is used, not the actual "minimum dependency." Check to
      # see if the requested version was installed as a dependency earlier.
      $candidate = Get-InstalledModule $_.name -RequiredVersion $version -ErrorAction Ignore
      if ($candidate) {
        $AllModules += New-Object -TypeName psobject -Property @{name=$_.name; version=$version}
      }
      else {
        $availableModules = Get-InstalledModule $_.name -AllVersions
        Write-Warning ("Could not find uninstall candidate for {0}:{1} - module may require manual uninstall. Available versions are: {2}" -f $_.name,$version,($availableModules.Version -join ', '))
      }
    }
  }
  $AllModules += New-Object -TypeName psobject -Property @{name=$TargetModule; version=$Version}

  foreach ($module in $AllModules) {
    Write-Host ('Uninstalling {0} version {1}...' -f $module.name,$module.version)
    try {
      Uninstall-Module -Name $module.name -RequiredVersion $module.version -Force:$Force -ErrorAction Stop -WhatIf:$WhatIf
    } catch {
      Write-Host ("`t" + $_.Exception.Message)
    }
  }
}
```

To use this function, copy and paste the code into your PowerShell session. The following example
shows how to run the function to remove an older version of Azure PowerShell.

```powershell-interactive
Uninstall-AllModules -TargetModule AzureRM -Version 4.4.1 -Force
```

As the script runs, it will display the name and version of each submodule that is being
uninstalled. To run the script to only see what would be deleted, without removing it,
use the `-WhatIf` option.

```output
Creating list of dependencies...
Uninstalling AzureRM.Profile version 3.4.1
Uninstalling Azure.Storage version 3.4.1
Uninstalling AzureRM.AnalysisServices version 0.4.7
Uninstalling Azure.AnalysisServices version 0.4.7
...
```

> [!NOTE]
> If this script can't match an exact dependency with the same version to uninstall, it won't uninstall _any_ version of that dependecy. This is because there may be
> other versions of the target module on your system which rely on these dependencies. In this case, the available versions of the dependency are listed.
> You can then remove any old versions manually with `Uninstall-Module`.


Run this command for every version of Azure PowerShell that you want to uninstall. For convenience, the following
script will uninstall all versions of AzureRM __except__ for the latest.

```powershell-interactive
$versions = (get-installedmodule AzureRM -AllVersions | Select-Object Version)
$versions[0..($versions.Length-2)]  | foreach { Uninstall-AllModules -TargetModule AzureRM -Version ($_.Version) -Force }
```
