# Install Azure PowerShell on Windows with PowerShellGet

[!INCLUDE [migrate-to-az-banner](../../includes/migrate-to-az-banner.md)]

This article explains the steps to install the Azure PowerShell modules for PowerShell 5.x for Windows using
PowerShellGet. PowerShellGet and module management is the preferred way to install Azure PowerShell but if you would rather install with
the Web Platform Installer or MSI package, see [Other installation methods](other-install.md).

The Azure classic deployment model is not supported by this version of Azure PowerShell. For support for classic deployments,
follow the instructions in [Install the Azure PowerShell Service Management module](/powershell/azure/servicemanagement/install-azure-ps).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AzureRM module is not supported for macOS or Linux. To use Azure PowerShell cmdlets on these platforms,
> [Install the Az module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

## Step 1: Install PowerShellGet

Installing items from the PowerShell Gallery requires the PowerShellGet module. Make sure you have
the appropriate version of PowerShellGet and other system requirements. Run the following command
to see if you have PowerShellGet installed on your system.


```powershell-interactive
Get-InstalledModule -Name PowerShellGet -ListAvailable | Select-Object -Property Name,Version,Path
```

You should see something similar to the following output:

```Output
Name          Version Path
----          ------- ----
Name          Version Path
----          ------- ----
PowerShellGet 1.6.0   C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PowerShellGet\1.6.0\PowerShellGet.psd1
PowerShellGet 1.0.0.1 C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PowerShellGet\1.0.0.1\PowerShellGet.psd1
```

You need PowerShellGet version 1.1.2.0 or higher. To update PowerShellGet, use the following command:

```powershell-interactive
Install-Module PowerShellGet -Force
```

If you do not have PowerShellGet installed, see the [How to get PowerShellGet](#how-to-get-powershellget)
section of this article.

> [!NOTE]
> Using PowerShellGet requires an Execution Policy that allows you to run scripts. For more
> information about PowerShell's Execution Policy, see
> [About Execution Policies](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies).
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The module described in this document, AzureRM, uses .NET Framework. This makes it incompatible with PowerShell 6.0,
> which uses .NET Core. If you are using PowerShell 6.0, follow the [installation instructions for
> macOS and Linux](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

## Step 2: Install Azure PowerShell

Installing Azure PowerShell from the PowerShell Gallery requires elevated privileges. Run the
following command from an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell-interactive
# Install the Azure Resource Manager modules from the PowerShell Gallery
Install-Module -Name AzureRM -AllowClobber
```

By default, the PowerShell gallery is not configured as a Trusted repository for PowerShellGet. The
first time you use the PSGallery you see the following prompt:

```Output
Untrusted repository

You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change
its InstallationPolicy value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet.

Are you sure you want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y
```

Answer 'Yes' or 'Yes to All' to continue with the installation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a version older than 2.8.5.201 of NuGet, you are prompted to download and install
> the latest version of NuGet.

The AzureRM module is a rollup module for the Azure Resource Manager cmdlets. When you install the
AzureRM module, any Azure PowerShell module not previously installed is downloaded and from the
PowerShell Gallery.

If you have a previous version of Azure PowerShell installed you may receive an error. To resolve
this issue, see the [Updating to a new version of Azure PowerShell](#update-azps) section of this
article.

## Step 3: Load the AzureRM module

Once the module is installed, you need to load the module into your PowerShell session. You should
do this in a normal (non-elevated) PowerShell session. Modules are loaded using the `Import-Module`
cmdlet, as follows:

```powershell-interactive
Import-Module -Name AzureRM
```

[Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/issues) section of our GitHub repo. To provide
feedback from the command line, use the `Send-Feedback` cmdlet.

## Frequently asked questions

### How to get PowerShellGet

|OS Version|Install instructions|
|---|---|
|I have Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016|Built into Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 included in the OS|
|I want to upgrade to PowerShell 5|[Install the latest version of WMF](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54616)|
|I am running on a version of Windows with PowerShell 3 or PowerShell 4|[Get the PackageManagement modules](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=746217)|

### <div id="helpmechoose"/>Checking the version of Azure PowerShell

Although we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version as early as possible, several versions
of Azure PowerShell are supported. To determine the version of Azure PowerShell you have installed,
run `Get-InstalledModule AzureRM` from your command line.

```powershell-interactive
Get-InstalledModule AzureRM -AllVersions | Select-Object -Property Name,Version,Path
```

### Support for classic deployment methods

If you have deployments that use the classic deployment model you can install the Service
Management version of Azure PowerShell. For more information, see [Install the Azure PowerShell
Service Management module](/powershell/azure/servicemanagement/install-azure-ps). The Azure and AzureRM modules share
common dependencies. If you use both the Azure and AzureRM modules, you should install the same
version of each package.

### <div id="update-azps"/>Updating to a new version of Azure PowerShell

If you have a previous version of Azure PowerShell installed that includes the Service Management
module, you may receive the following error:

```Output
PackageManagement\Install-Package : A command with name 'Get-AzureStorageContainerAcl' is already
available on this system. This module 'Azure.Storage' may override the existing commands. If you
still want to install this module 'Azure.Storage', use -AllowClobber parameter.

At C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PowerShellGet\1.0.0.1\PSModule.psm1:1772 char:21
+ ...          $null = PackageManagement\Install-Package @PSBoundParameters
+                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (Microsoft.Power....InstallPackage:InstallPackage) [Install-Package], Exception
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandAlreadyAvailable,Validate-ModuleCommandAlreadyAvailable,Microsoft.PowerShell.PackageManagement.Cmdlets.InstallPackage
```

As the error message states, you need to use the -AllowClobber parameter to install the module. Use
the following command:

```powershell-interactive
# Install the Azure Resource Manager modules from the PowerShell Gallery
Install-Module -Name AzureRM -AllowClobber
```

For more information, see the help topic for
[Install-Module](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/reference/5.1/PowerShellGet/install-module).

### Installing module versions side by side

The PowerShellGet method of installation is the only method that supports the installation of
multiple versions. For example, you may have scripts written using a previous version of Azure
PowerShell that you don't have the time or resources to updated. The following commands illustrate
how to install multiple versions of Azure PowerShell:

```powershell-interactive
Install-Module -Name AzureRM -RequiredVersion 3.7.0
Install-Module -Name AzureRM -RequiredVersion 2.3.0
```

Only one version of the module can be loaded in a PowerShell session. You must open a new
PowerShell window and use `Import-Module` to import a specific version of the AzureRM cmdlets:

```powershell-interactive
Import-Module -Name AzureRM -RequiredVersion 2.3.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> Version 2.1.0 and version 1.2.6 are the first module versions designed to be installed and used
side by side. When loading an earlier version of the Azure PowerShell, incompatible versions of the
**AzureRM.Profile** module are loaded. This results in the cmdlets prompting you to sign in whenever
you execute a cmdlet.
