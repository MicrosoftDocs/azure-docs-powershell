        In this tutorial, you learn all of the steps involved in setting up a virtual machine with
        Azure PowerShell. The tutorial also covers output queries, Azure resource reuse, and
        resource cleanup.

        This tutorial can be completed with the interactive experience offered through Azure Cloud
        Shell, or you may [install Azure PowerShell](install-az-ps.md) locally.

        Use __ctrl-shift-v__ (__cmd-shift-v__ on macOS) to paste tutorial text into Azure Cloud
        Shell.

      title: Sign in
      content: |-
        If you're using a local install of the Azure PowerShell, you need to sign in before
        performing any other steps.

        ```powershell-interactive
        Connect-AzAccount
        ```

        Complete the sign in process by following the steps displayed in your terminal.

      title: Create a resource group
      content: |-
        In Azure, all resources are allocated in a resource management group. Resource groups
        provide logical groupings of resources that make them easier to work with as a collection.
        For this tutorial, all of the created resources go into a single group named
        `TutorialResources`.

        ```powershell-interactive
        New-AzResourceGroup -Name TutorialResources -Location eastus
        ```

        ```Output
        ResourceGroupName : TutorialResources
        Location          : eastus
        ProvisioningState : Succeeded
        Tags              :
        ResourceId        : /subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/TutorialResources
        ```

      title: Create admin credentials for the VM
      content: |-
        Before you can create a new virtual machine, you must create a credential object containing
        the username and password for the administrator account of the Windows VM.

        ```powershell-interactive
        $cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."
        ```

        Enter the username and password when prompted. The resulting credential object is passed as
        a parameter in the next step.

        ```Output
        Windows PowerShell credential request.
        Enter a username and password for the virtual machine.
        User: tutorAdmin
        Password for user tutorAdmin: *********
        ```

      title: Create a virtual machine
      content: |-
        Virtual machines in Azure have a large number of dependencies. The Azure PowerShell creates
        these resources for you based on the command-line arguments you specify. For readability, we
        are using [PowerShell splatting](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_splatting)
        to pass parameters to the Azure PowerShell cmdlets.

        Create a new virtual machine running Windows.

        ```powershell-interactive
        $vmParams = @{
          ResourceGroupName = 'TutorialResources'
          Name = 'TutorialVM1'
          Location = 'eastus'
          ImageName = 'Win2016Datacenter'
          PublicIpAddressName = 'tutorialPublicIp'
          Credential = $cred
          OpenPorts = 3389
        }
        $newVM1 = New-AzVM @vmParams
        ```
        As the VM is created, you see the parameter values used and Azure resources being created.
        PowerShell will displace a progress bar as shown below.

        ```Output
         Creating Azure resources
          39% \
          [ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo                                                                 ]

          Creating TutorialVM1 virtual machine.
        ```

        Once the VM is ready, we can view the results in the Azure Portal or by inspecting the
        \$newVM1 variable.

        ```powershell-interactive
        $newVM1
        ```

        ```Output
        ResourceGroupName : TutorialResources
        Id                : /subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/TutorialResources/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/TutorialVM1
        VmId              : 12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcedf0
        Name              : TutorialVM1
        Type              : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
        Location          : eastus
        Tags              : {}
        HardwareProfile   : {VmSize}
        NetworkProfile    : {NetworkInterfaces}
        OSProfile         : {ComputerName, AdminUsername, WindowsConfiguration, Secrets}
        ProvisioningState : Succeeded
        StorageProfile    : {ImageReference, OsDisk, DataDisks}
        ```

        Property values listed inside of braces are nested objects. In the next step we will show you
        how to view specific values in these nested objects.

      title: Get VM information with queries
      content: |-
        Let's get some more detailed information from the VM we just created. In this example, we verify
        the Name of the VM and the admin account we created.

        ```powershell-interactive
        $newVM1.OSProfile | Select-Object ComputerName,AdminUserName
        ```

        ```Output
        ComputerName AdminUsername
        ------------ -------------
        TutorialVM1  tutorialAdmin
        ```

        We can use other Azure PowerShell commands to get specific information about the network
        configuration.

        ```powershell-interactive
        $newVM1 | Get-AzNetworkInterface |
          Select-Object -ExpandProperty IpConfigurations |
            Select-Object Name,PrivateIpAddress
        ```

        In this example we are using the PowerShell pipeline to send the \$newVM1 object to the
        `Get-AzNetworkInterface` cmdlet. From the resulting network interface object we are
        selecting the nested IpConfigurations object. From the IpConfigurations object we are
        selecting the Name and PrivateIpAddress properties.

        ```Output
        Name        PrivateIpAddress
        ----        ----------------
        TutorialVM1 192.168.1.4
        ```

        To confirm that the VM is running, we need to connect via Remote Desktop. For that, we need
        to know the Public IP address.

        ```powershell-interactive
        $publicIp = Get-AzPublicIpAddress -Name tutorialPublicIp -ResourceGroupName TutorialResources

        $publicIp | Select-Object Name,IpAddress,@{label='FQDN';expression={$_.DnsSettings.Fqdn}}
        ```

        In this example, we use the `Get-AzPublicIpAddress` and store the results in the
        \$publicIp variable. From this variable we are selecting properties and using an expression
        to retrieve the nested Fqdn property.

        ```Output
        Name             IpAddress           FQDN
        ----             ---------           ----
        tutorialPublicIp <PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS> tutorialvm1-8a0999.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
        ```

        From your local machine you can run the following command to connect to the VM over Remote
        Desktop.

        ```powershell-interactive
        mstsc.exe /v <PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
        ```

        For more information about querying for object properties, see
        [Querying for Azure resources](./queries-azureps.md).

      title: Creating a new VM on the existing subnet
      content: |-
        The second VM uses the existing subnet.

        ```powershell-interactive
        $vm2Params = @{
          ResourceGroupName = 'TutorialResources'
          Name = 'TutorialVM2'
          ImageName = 'Win2016Datacenter'
          VirtualNetworkName = 'TutorialVM1'
          SubnetName = 'TutorialVM1'
          PublicIpAddressName = 'tutorialPublicIp2'
          Credential = $cred
          OpenPorts = 3389
        }
        $newVM2 = New-AzVM @vm2Params

        $newVM2
        ```

        ```Output
        ResourceGroupName        : TutorialResources
        Id                       : /subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/TutorialResources/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/TutorialVM2
        VmId                     : 12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcedf1
        Name                     : TutorialVM2
        Type                     : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
        Location                 : eastus
        Tags                     : {}
        HardwareProfile          : {VmSize}
        NetworkProfile           : {NetworkInterfaces}
        OSProfile                : {ComputerName, AdminUsername, WindowsConfiguration, Secrets}
        ProvisioningState        : Succeeded
        StorageProfile           : {ImageReference, OsDisk, DataDisks}
        FullyQualifiedDomainName : tutorialvm2-dfa5af.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
        ```

        You can skip a few steps to get the public IP address of the new VM since it's returned in
        the FullyQualifiedDomainName property of the \$newVM2 object. Use the following command to
        connect using Remote Desktop.

        ```powershell-interactive
        mstsc.exe /v $newVM2.FullyQualifiedDomainName
        ```

      title: Cleanup
      content: |-
        Now that the tutorial is complete, it's time to clean up the created resources. You can
        delete individual resources with the `Remove-AzResource` command, but the safest way
        to remove all resources in a resource group is delete the group using the
        `Remove-AzResourceGroup` command.

        ```powershell-interactive
        $job = Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name TutorialResources -Force -AsJob

        $job
        ```

        ```Output
        Id     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command
        --     ----            -------------   -----         -----------     --------             -------
        1      Long Running... AzureLongRun... Running       True            localhost            Remove-AzResource...
        ```

        This command deletes the resources created during the tutorial, and is guaranteed to deallocate
        them in the correct order. The `-AsJob` parameter keeps PowerShell from blocking while the
        deletion takes place. To wait until the deletion is complete, use the following command:

        ```powershell-interactive
        Wait-Job -Id $job.Id
        ```

        With cleanup completed, the tutorial is finished. Continue on for a summary of everything
        you learned and links to resources that will help you with your next steps.
