# Get started with Azure PowerShell

[!INCLUDE [migrate-to-az-banner](../../includes/migrate-to-az-banner.md)]

Azure PowerShell is designed for managing and administering Azure resources from the command line,
and for building automation scripts that work against the Azure Resource Manager. You can use it in
your browser with [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview) or you install it on your
local machine. This article helps get you started with Azure PowerShell and teaches the core concepts behind it.

## Install Azure PowerShell

The first step is to make sure you have the latest version of the Azure PowerShell installed. For
information about the latest release, see the [release notes](./release-notes-azureps.md).

1. [Install Azure PowerShell](install-azurerm-ps.md).

2. To verify the installation was successful, run `Get-InstalledModule AzureRM -AllVersions` from your
   command line.

## Azure Cloud Shell

The simplest way to get started is to [launch Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart).

1. Launch Cloud Shell from the top navigation of the Azure portal.

   ![Shell icon](~/media/get-started-azureps/shell-icon.png)

2. Choose the subscription you want to use and create a storage account.

   ![Create a storage account](~/media/get-started-azureps/storage-prompt.png)

Once your storage has been created, the Cloud Shell will open a PowerShell session in the browser.

![Cloud Shell for PowerShell](~/media/get-started-azureps/cloud-powershell.png)

You can also install Azure PowerShell and use it locally in a PowerShell session.

## Sign in to Azure

Sign on interactively:

1. Type `Connect-AzureRmAccount`. You'll get a dialog box asking for your Azure credentials. Option
  '-Environment' can let you authenticate for Azure China or Azure Germany.

   for example, Connect-AzureRmAccount -Environment AzureChinaCloud

2. Type the email address and password associated with your account. Azure authenticates and saves
   the credential information, and then closes the window.

Once you have signed in to an Azure account, you can use the Azure PowerShell cmdlets to access and
manage the resources in your subscription.

## Create a Windows virtual machine using simple defaults

The `New-AzureRmVM` cmdlet provides a simplified syntax making it easy to create a new virtual
machine. There are only two parameter values you must provide: the name of the VM and a set of
credentials for the local administrator account on the VM.

First, create the credential object.

```azurepowershell-interactive
$cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter a username and password for the virtual machine."
```

```output
Windows PowerShell credential request.
Enter a username and password for the virtual machine.
User: localAdmin
Password for user localAdmin: *********
```

Next, create the VM.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmVM -Name SampleVM -Credential $cred
```

```output
ResourceGroupName        : SampleVM
Id                       : /subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/SampleVM/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/SampleVM
VmId                     : 43f6275d-ce50-49c8-a831-5d5974006e63
Name                     : SampleVM
Type                     : Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
Location                 : eastus
Tags                     : {}
HardwareProfile          : {VmSize}
NetworkProfile           : {NetworkInterfaces}
OSProfile                : {ComputerName, AdminUsername, WindowsConfiguration, Secrets}
ProvisioningState        : Succeeded
StorageProfile           : {ImageReference, OsDisk, DataDisks}
FullyQualifiedDomainName : samplevm-2c0867.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com
```

You may wonder what else is created and how is the VM configured. First, let's
look at our resource groups.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzureRmResourceGroup | Select-Object ResourceGroupName,Location
```

```output
ResourceGroupName          Location
-----------------          --------
cloud-shell-storage-westus westus
SampleVM                   eastus
```

The **cloud-shell-storage-westus** resource group is created the first time you use the Cloud
Shell. The **SampleVM** resource group was created by the `New-AzureRmVM` cmdlet.

Now, what other resources were created in this new resource group?

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzureRmResource |
  Where ResourceGroupName -eq SampleVM |
    Select-Object ResourceGroupName,Location,ResourceType,Name
```

```output
ResourceGroupName          Location ResourceType                            Name
-----------------          -------- ------------                            ----
SAMPLEVM                   eastus   Microsoft.Compute/disks                 SampleVM_OsDisk_1_9b286c54b168457fa1f8c47...
SampleVM                   eastus   Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines       SampleVM
SampleVM                   eastus   Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces     SampleVM
SampleVM                   eastus   Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups SampleVM
SampleVM                   eastus   Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses     SampleVM
SampleVM                   eastus   Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks       SampleVM
```

Let's get some more details about the VM. This example shows how to retrieve
information about the OS Image used to create the VM.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzureRmVM -Name SampleVM -ResourceGroupName SampleVM |
  Select-Object -ExpandProperty StorageProfile |
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty ImageReference
```

```output
Publisher : MicrosoftWindowsServer
Offer     : WindowsServer
Sku       : 2016-Datacenter
Version   : latest
Id        :
```

## Create a fully configured Linux Virtual Machine

The previous example used the simplified syntax and default parameter values to create a Windows
virtual machine. In this example, we provide values for all options of the virtual machine.

### Create a resource group

In this example, we want to create a Resource Group. Resource Groups in Azure provide a way to
manage multiple resources that you want to logically group together. For example, you might create
a Resource Group for an application or project and add a virtual machine, a database and a CDN
service within it.

Let's create a resource group named "MyResourceGroup" in the westeurope region of Azure. To do so
type the following command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name 'myResourceGroup' -Location 'westeurope'
```

```output
ResourceGroupName : myResourceGroup
Location          : westeurope
ProvisioningState : Succeeded
Tags              :
ResourceId        : /subscriptions/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup
```

This new resource group will be used to contain all of the resources needed for the new VM we
create. To create a new Linux VM, we must first create the other required resources and assign them
to a configuration. Then we can use that configuration to create the VM. Also, you will need to
have an SSH public key named `id_rsa.pub` in the .ssh directory of your user profile.

#### Create the required network resources

First we need to create a subnet configuration to be used with the virtual network creation
process. We also create a public IP address so that we can connect to this VM. We create a network
security group to secure access to the public address. Finally we create the virtual NIC using all
of the previous resources.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Variables for common values
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$location = "westeurope"
$vmName = "myLinuxVM"

# Definer user name and blank password
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'azurepassword' -AsPlainText -Force
$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("azureuser", $securePassword)

# Create a subnet configuration
$subnetConfig = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name mySubnet2 -AddressPrefix 192.168.2.0/24

# Create a virtual network
$vnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -Name MYvNET2 -AddressPrefix 192.168.0.0/16 -Subnet $subnetConfig

# Create a public IP address and specify a DNS name
$publicIp = New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -Name "mypublicdns$(Get-Random)" -AllocationMethod Static -IdleTimeoutInMinutes 4
$publicIp | Select-Object Name,IpAddress

# Create an inbound network security group rule for port 22
$nsgRuleSSH = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name myNetworkSecurityGroupRuleSSH  -Protocol Tcp `
  -Direction Inbound -Priority 1000 -SourceAddressPrefix * -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * `
  -DestinationPortRange 22 -Access Allow

# Create a network security group
$nsg = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -Name myNetworkSecurityGroup2 -SecurityRules $nsgRuleSSH

# Create a virtual network card and associate with public IP address and NSG
$nic = New-AzureRmNetworkInterface -Name myNic2 -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location `
  -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $publicIp.Id -NetworkSecurityGroupId $nsg.Id
```

### Create the VM configuration

Now that we have the required resources we can create the VM configuration object.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create a virtual machine configuration
$vmConfig = New-AzureRmVMConfig -VMName $vmName -VMSize Standard_D1 |
  Set-AzureRmVMOperatingSystem -Linux -ComputerName $vmName -Credential $cred -DisablePasswordAuthentication |
  Set-AzureRmVMSourceImage -PublisherName Canonical -Offer UbuntuServer -Skus 14.04.2-LTS -Version latest |
  Add-AzureRmVMNetworkInterface -Id $nic.Id

# Configure SSH Keys
$sshPublicKey = Get-Content -Raw "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub"
Add-AzureRmVMSshPublicKey -VM $vmConfig -KeyData $sshPublicKey -Path "/home/azureuser/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

### Create the virtual machine

Now we can create the VM using the VM configuration object.

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location -VM $vmConfig
```

Now that the VM has been created, you can sign in to your new Linux VM using SSH with the public IP
address of the VM you created:

```bash
ssh xx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

```output

## Creating other resources in Azure

We've now walked through how to create a Resource Group, a Linux VM, and a Windows Server VM. You
can create many other types of Azure resources as well.

For example, to create an Azure Network Load Balancer that we could then associate with our newly
created VMs, we can use the following create command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
New-AzureRmLoadBalancer -Name MyLoadBalancer -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location westeurope
```

We could also create a new private Virtual Network (commonly referred to as a "VNet" within Azure)
for our infrastructure using the following command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
$subnetConfig = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name mySubnet2 -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16
$vnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location westeurope `
  -Name MYvNET3 -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Subnet $subnetConfig
```

What makes Azure and the Azure PowerShell powerful is that we can use it not just to get
cloud-based infrastructure but also to create managed platform services. The managed platform
services can also be combined with infrastructure to build even more powerful solutions.

For example, you can use the Azure PowerShell to create an Azure AppService. Azure AppService is a
managed platform service that provides a great way to host web apps without having to worry about
infrastructure. After creating the Azure AppService, you can create two new Azure Web Apps within
the AppService using the following commands:

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Create an Azure AppService that we can host any number of web apps within
New-AzureRmAppServicePlan -Name MyAppServicePlan -Tier Basic -NumberofWorkers 2 -WorkerSize Small -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location westeurope

# Create Two Web Apps within the AppService (note: name param must be a unique DNS entry)
New-AzureRmWebApp -Name MyWebApp43432 -AppServicePlan MyAppServicePlan -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location westeurope
New-AzureRmWebApp -Name MyWebApp43433 -AppServicePlan MyAppServicePlan -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Location westeurope
```

## Listing deployed resources

You can use the `Get-AzureRmResource` cmdlet to list the resources running in Azure. The following
example shows the resources we created in the new resource group.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzureRmResource |
  Where-Object ResourceGroupName -eq myResourceGroup |
    Select-Object Name,Location,ResourceType
```

```output
Name                                                  Location   ResourceType
----                                                  --------   ------------

myWindowsVM_OsDisk_1_f627e6e2bb454c72897d72e9632adf9a westeurope Microsoft.Compute/disks
myLinuxVM                                             westeurope Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
myWindowsVM                                           westeurope Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines
myWindowsVM/BGInfo                                    westeurope Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions
myNic1                                                westeurope Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces

micromyresomywi032907510                              westeurope Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
```

## Deleting resources

To clean up your Azure account, you want to remove the resources we created in this example. You
can use the `Remove-AzureRm*` cmdlets to delete the resources you no longer need. To remove the
Windows VM we created, using the following command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzureRmVM -Name myWindowsVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup
```

You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to remove the resource.

```output
Confirm
Are you sure you want to remove resource group 'myResourceGroup'
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y
```

You can also delete many resources at once. For example, the following command deletes
the resource group "MyResourceGroup" that we've used for all the samples so far.
All resources in the group are also deleted.

```azurepowershell-interactive
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup
```

```output
Confirm
Are you sure you want to remove resource group 'myResourceGroup'
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y
```

The task can take several minutes to complete, depending on the number and type of resources.
