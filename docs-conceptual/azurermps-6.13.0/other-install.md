# Install Azure PowerShell on Windows with MSI

[!INCLUDE [migrate-to-az-banner](../../includes/migrate-to-az-banner.md)]

This article explains how to install Azure PowerShell on Windows using an MSI installer.
Use these installation methods only if they're necessary for your system. The recommended way to install Azure PowerShell
on Windows is with PowerShellGet. For instructions on using PowerShellGet to install Azure PowerShell,
see [Install Azure PowerShell with PowerShellGet](install-azurerm-ps.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The Web Platform Installer method of installation is no longer available for versions of Azure PowerShell 6.x
> and higher. If you require use of the Web Platform Installer please consider using the MSI instead, or you can
> install an earlier version of Azure PowerShell.

## Install or update on Windows using the MSI Package

Azure PowerShell for Windows PowerShell 5.x can be installed using the MSI file available from
[GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/releases/tag/v6.13.1-November2018). If you have installed previous
versions of Azure modules as an MSI, the installer automatically removes them. The MSI package installs
modules in `${env:ProgramFiles}\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`. Both the `AzureRM` and `Azure` modules are installed.

> [!NOTE]
> Only use the `Azure` module if you are working with the Azure classic deployment model.

To start working with Azure PowerShell, sign in with your Azure credentials.

```powershell-interactive
# Connect to Azure with an interactive dialog for sign-in
Connect-AzureRmAccount
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you've disabled module autoloading, you need to manually import the module with `Import-Module AzureRM`. Because of
> the way the module is structured, this can take a few seconds.

You'll need to repeat this step for every new PowerShell session you start. To learn how to persist your
Azure sign-in across PowerShell sessions, see [Persist user credentials across PowerShell sessions](context-persistence.md).
