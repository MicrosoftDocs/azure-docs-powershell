      - question: |
          What is Azure PowerShell?
        answer: |
          Azure PowerShell is a set of cmdlets that allows you to manage Azure resources directly with
          PowerShell. In December 2018, the Az PowerShell module became generally available. It's now the
          recommended PowerShell module for interacting with Azure. To learn more about the Az PowerShell
          module, see
          [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az).

      - question: |
          How do I disable breaking change warning messages in Azure PowerShell?
        answer: |
          To suppress the breaking change warning messages in Azure PowerShell, you'll need to set the
          environment variable `SuppressAzurePowerShellBreakingChangeWarnings` to `true`.

          ```azurepowershell
          Set-Item -Path Env:\SuppressAzurePowerShellBreakingChangeWarnings -Value $true
          ```

      - question: |
          How do I disable the AzureRM retirement warning message in Azure PowerShell?
        answer: |
          To suppress the AzureRM retirement warning message in Azure PowerShell, you'll need to set the
          environment variable `SuppressAzureRmModulesRetiringWarning` to `true`.

          ```azurepowershell-interactive
          Set-Item -Path Env:\SuppressAzureRmModulesRetiringWarning -Value $true
          ```

          One disadvantage of the previous example is you'll need to run the command for each new PowerShell
          session unless you add it to your PowerShell profile.

          To set the environment variable permanently, you can also use the following example.

          ```azurepowershell-interactive
          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SuppressAzureRmModulesRetiringWarning', 'true', [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
          ```

      - question: |
          How do I determine the max HTTP retry times in Azure PowerShell?
        answer: |
          For general HTTP response (except response status code is 429), Azure PowerShell uses the value defined in the `AZURE_PS_HTTP_MAX_RETRIES` environment variable. Its minimum value is 0. If not specified, Azure PowerShell uses the SDK default value.

          ```azurepowershell-interactive
          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_PS_HTTP_MAX_RETRIES ', 3, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
          ```

          If the HTTP response status code is 429, Azure PowerShell uses the value defined in the `AZURE_PS_HTTP_MAX_RETRIES_FOR_429` environment variable. Its minimum value is 1. The total retry times of status code 429 is (`AZURE_PS_HTTP_MAX_RETRIES` + 1) * `AZURE_PS_HTTP_MAX_RETRIES_FOR_429` - 1. If not specified, Azure PowerShell uses the SDK default value.

          ```azurepowershell-interactive
          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('AZURE_PS_HTTP_MAX_RETRIES_FOR_429 ', 3, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
          ```
