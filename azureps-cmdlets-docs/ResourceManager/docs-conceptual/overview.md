# Overview of Azure PowerShell

Azure PowerShell provides a set of cmdlets that use the
[Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview) model for managing
your Azure resources.

Review the [Install](install-azurerm-ps.md) article to get Azure PowerShell up and running on your
system. Then read the [Get Started](get-started-azureps.md) article to begin using it. For information about the latest
release, see the [release notes](release-notes-azureps.md).

The following samples can help you learn how to perform common scenarios with Azure PowerShell:

* [Linux Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-powershell-samples?toc=/powershell/azure/toc.json)
* [Windows Virtual Machines](/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-powershell-samples?toc=/powershell/azure/toc.json)
* [Web Apps](/azure/app-service-web/app-service-powershell-samples?toc=/powershell/azure/toc.json)
* [SQL Databases](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-powershell-samples?toc=/powershell/azure/toc.json)

> [!NOTE]
> If you have deployments that use the classic deployment model that cannot be converted, you can
install the Service Management version of Azure PowerShell. For more information, see
[Install the Azure PowerShell Service Management module](/powershell/azure/servicemanagement/install-azure-ps).
